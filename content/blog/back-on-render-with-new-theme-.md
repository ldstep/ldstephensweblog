The other day I mentioned I was testing xmit for hosting. Long story short—it was confusing to set up, and I didn’t feel comfortable with the process. I reached out to the developer for help and never heard back, which didn’t exactly inspire confidence.

The site is now back on [Render](https://render.com) with a new theme.
