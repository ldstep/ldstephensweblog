A couple of weeks ago, I completed several projects in preparation for winter. I fired up the Yardmax 30-ton splitter to ensure it's ready for a workout. I also cleaned out the old ash from the burn barrel to prepare it for use and tidied up one of the chicken coops.

This afternoon, I gave the Yardmax its first workout, splitting and stacking one-third of a cord of wood. There's more to go.
