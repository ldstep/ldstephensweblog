These are articles I read today. Seeing something here doesn't mean I agree with it or endorse the source. It just means it caught my attention and I read it. Take it for what it's worth.

The list isn't in any special order. It's just the order I added things. These are pieces I read today, not necessarily ones published today, so check the dates if that matters to you.
