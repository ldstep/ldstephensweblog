# Notes

_Notes are shorter random posts, kinda like a microblog._

I changed how I’m using weblog.ldstephens.net. Instead of a separate standalone site, I have integrated it with ldstephens.net as a slash page.

> For personal journaling, I’ve used Org-journal in Emacs for years. However, there’s nothing like Day One for dealing with photos, geolocation, and resurfacing past entries with the “On This Day” feature. Plus, mobile. So I’ve continued using Org-journal, but at the end of each month, I import the entries into Day One.

[Jack Baty](https://baty.net/posts/2025/07/duplication/)

I do something similar, but instead of using Emacs, I use Drafts. Drafts has a nice [Monthly Journal Action](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-journaling-in-drafts/5803). Throughout the month, I write journal entries in Drafts, and then at the end of the month, I have an action that sends the Monthly Journal to Day One.

This morning I'm playing around with Stage Manager in iPadOS 26. I'm setting up a writing stage with Drafts, Yoink, ChatGPT, and Safari.

When I'm on my iPad I'll write in Drafts, use ChatGPT to proofread, do my research in Safari, and keep track of clipboard history with Yoink.

> While the iPad now gets much closer to the usability of a Mac, the Mac still wins out for a number of reasons:

iPadOS 26 Beta 2 was released this afternoon, so I installed it. For how I use my iPad, I don't see much of a change.

---

June 23, 2025, at 10:44:04 AM

My living on my iPad experiment is officially over. iPadOS 26 is still missing things that I depend on that are Mac-only. I'll continue to use it, which is for consumption and occasional writing.

---

June 20, 2025, at 2:17:26 PM

This morning, I encountered a few issues with the iPadOS 26 beta. Consequently, I had to switch to my MacBook to complete the project I was working on. I don’t blame the iPad; it’s just a beta.

---

June 15, 2025 at 02:32:24 PM

I’m contemplating living on my iPad throughout the iPadOS 26 beta period. Once the public release is available, I’ll make a decision about how the iPad will integrate into my computing lifestyle.

I sorta came up with a way to see the activity of RSS readers by setting up a Netlify function listing user agents. What I'm looking for are the Reeder and NetNewsWire user agents. Got the idea from a Kev Quirk post. We'll see if it works?

---

June 10, 2025 at 05:49:48 PM

WWDC was yesterday. The changes coming to iPadOS 26 sound very interesting. So interesting that I may, for the time ever, install a developer beta so that I can experience what's new in iPadOS 26.

Four hours of yard work today and I’ve got all the power tools. Riding zero-turn mower, power push mower, string trimmer, blower, and it still takes four hours every week. Yeah, the yard’s big. Three acres maintained, ten total, plus a trail we keep cleared around the property.

I’m seriously considering a base model M4 MacBook Pro but I’m going to wait until after WWDC before pulling the trigger.

I’ve been messing around with other apps out of boredom, thinking maybe they could replace what I already use. They can’t. I know what works! I should just stick with it and stop wasting time pretending otherwise.

I’ve been tinkering with BBEdit today. With the assistance of ChatGPT, I developed some shell scripts and incorporated keyboard shortcuts to mimic the process of adding markdown syntax.

---

May 26, 2025, at 4:02:38 PM

The other day I decided to keep blog post ideas, write blog posts, and journal in MarkEdit instead of Drafts. Today I'm back to using Drafts, but I'm no longer archiving anything there.

---

May 21, 2025, at 3:38:33 PM

I’m thinking about how I search for and open documents. I have to start a search query somewhere—whether that’s Alfred, Drafts, DEVONthink, Finder, or HoudahSpot—and then I still have to open the document. With that in mind, there’s no real advantage to keeping all my archived documents in Drafts, since I can just as easily search for and open them with any of the other tools in my preferred Markdown editor.

---

May 15, 2025, at 2:59:40 PM

Since I started using Plausible Analytics, I’ve discovered that ldstephens still receives a fair amount of traffic from search, particularly Google Search. Therefore, I re-enabled the site on Google Search Console.

Every day, I dread the possibility of breaking something in this 11ty project and being unable to fix it. To mitigate this risk, I’ve created a shell script that backs up this project to an external drive multiple times a day.

Last night, two more baby chicks died, bringing the total to four in less than a week. This is the first time we’ve ever lost baby chicks. We got this batch from a different supplier than usual. I can’t help but wonder if it’s a quality issue. Still, we went back to the same place and picked up four more today. Hopefully, these do better. We would have gone to our regular supplier, but they don’t have the breed we want.

I canceled my Netlify analytics subscription today and received a refund. I’m continuing the Plausible free trial.

---

May 8, 2025, at 12:01:32 PM

I'm running analytics on ldstephens again, testing both Plausible and Netlify. Netlify doesn't block bots, so its stats are wildly inflated making them basically useless. Plausible blocks known bots, but some ad blockers filter it out, slightly understating the numbers.

---

May 6, 2025, at 10:20:24 AM

The runt of the baby chick didn’t make it. She was struggling yesterday. We rerouted the heat lamp to keep everyone warmer. We worked with her, giving her vitamin boosts, helping her eat and drink, but she just couldn’t fight this morning. We’re sad! Amazing how quickly they become pets that you love. RIP, little one.

I occasionally switch from Alfred to Raycast. When I do, I also run Keyboard Maestro for automation. But when I'm using Alfred, most of my automation is handled through its workflows, so I don't need Keyboard Maestro.

That's why I switch: I prefer Alfred over Raycast, but I like Keyboard Maestro better than Alfred for automation. Today I decided to stop switching. I'm sticking with Alfred and using Keyboard Maestro for automation. Each app gets to do what it does best.

Apple Notes on iOS 18 now has a new feature called Recent Notes. It lets you quickly jump between the last 10 notes you looked at. This makes it much easier and faster for people with lots of notes, as you don’t need to dig through all your folders.

To access this feature, tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the app. You’ll see a Recent Notes option. Tap it to view the last 10 notes you checked out.

What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers, unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of business. The proposal has broad support despite not addressing data breaches directly.
