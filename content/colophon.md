# Colophon

This blog is a static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), using [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/), and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It automatically deploys whenever I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephensweblog).

The domain is registered through [Hover](https://hover.com/).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and added to a new post in Sublime Text.
