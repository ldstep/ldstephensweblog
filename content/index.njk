   <p>Hey, I&#8217;m ldstephens. This domain isn&#8217;t my first; I&#8217;ve been writing online since the late 1990s, and I can&#8217;t count how many times I&#8217;ve pulled the plug on previous blogs.</p>

   <p>For now, this is my little corner of the web where I share whatever&#8217;s on my mind: stories, random thoughts, and the occasional rant. You&#8217;ll also find quotes that resonate with me and links I believe are worth sharing. Nothing fancy, just the small but meaningful stuff from my day-to-day life.</p>

   <p>Anyway, I have no clue where this thing is going. Could be great, could be a mess. Either way, stick around. Or don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s your call.</p>
