        Hey, I&#8217;m ldstephens. This blog isn&#8217;t my first; I&#8217;ve
        been writing online since the late 1990s, and I can&#8217;t count how
        many times I&#8217;ve pulled the plug on previous blogs.
    </p>

    <p>
        For now, this is my little corner of the web where I share
        whatever&#8217;s on my mind: stories, random thoughts, and the
        occasional rant. You&#8217;ll also find quotes that resonate with me and
        links I believe are worth sharing. Nothing fancy, just the small but
        meaningful stuff from my day-to-day life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyway, I have no clue where this thing is going. Could be great, could
        be a mess. Either way, stick around. Or don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s your
        call.
    </p>
